##### Links in Linux
There are two types of links in linux : softlink and hardlink. Softlink(or symbolic link) is a file that refers to location of </br>
another file or directory.</br>

##### cat
cat command reads all the files on its command line and prints their contents to the
standard output. If no file names are supplied, cat reads the standard input. It is an appropriate command when
more than one file needs to be read or when a file needs to be included with the output of other commands:

##### head
By default, head prints the first ten lines of each file on the command line, or from the standard input if no
file name is given. The -n option changes that default:
$ head -n 1 "$kjv"
